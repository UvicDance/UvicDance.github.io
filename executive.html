                Hello! My name is Taya and I am delighted to be your President again this semester.
                I am a fourth year History student and life-long dancer.
                Since joining the club I have not only reconnected with my love of dance, but have also had the
                opportunity to learn from so many amazing people.
                This club brought me to some of my very best friends and I cannot recommend it enough to those who are
                looking for a way to learn a new skill in a fun and welcoming social environment.
                I hope you’ll join us this year, I can’t wait to see you all on the dance floor!

                Hi:) I'm Aria and I'm a biology and psychology student.
                This will be my second semester on the exec team and I am super excited to be filling the role of Vice
                President!
                When I first joined the UVBLSC, I had almost no dance experience.
                Despite fully believing I had two left feet, I immediately fell in love with swing dancing (and was
                proved wrong).
                After a semester of taking swing, I finally had the courage to try out the latin dance classes and now
                I'm taking pretty much every possible opportunity to dance!
                The club has given me many cool opportunities from learning to dance, preforming on stage and making
                amazing friends.
                Even if you think you don't like dancing or that you wouldn't be good at it, I'd encourage you to give
                the UVBLSC a try, you might be surprised!

                I have always had an intense passion for the creative arts.
                Growing up, I acted in many school musicals and played trombone in concert and jazz band.
                I was never interested in P.E. or any kind of physical activity, but my interest in jazz led me towards
                swing dancing classes in my first year at UVic.
                As fun as swing was, I found myself entirely captivated by salsa and latin rhythms, where I found a
                passion for learning how movement connects with my partner and the music.
                Joining this welcoming community has allowed me to participate in many amazing opportunities like
                travelling internationally to perform, social dancing to live music by the top salsa bands, taking as
                many hours of dance class as I can fit in each week, and constantly making new friends.
                I hope to see you on the dance floor!

                I come from a background of musical theatre, drama, and singing.
                I joined the club in my first year of UVic hoping to try something fun, social, and physical.
                I had no experience social dancing when I started, but quickly found myself having tons of fun making
                new friends and learning to dance with so many wonderful people.
                It has been a blast learning to dance, and it's an amazing way to make new friends.
                I look forwards to spending time with all the old and new people that come to the club this year.

                10/10 would recommend.

                Hi everyone, I’m Alex, a fourth year Electrical Engineering student.
                This is my third semester with the club and my first on the executive team.
                I only had marginal dance experience before joining the club although lots of experience in sports.
                With dance, I have improved my physical coordination and confidence.
                I felt safe and welcomed by the club and the executive team when I first started dancing.
                On my first day of free classes with the club when everything was online I loved it so much that I
                immediately bought the membership.

                Hi! I’m Eva, an Education major earning a certificate in Media Studies. I joined the club in 2023 after
                taking the free classes during the first weekend. The energy, kindness, and sense of community had me
                hooked instantly. I walked straight to CARSA after class to get my membership because I knew this was
                where I wanted to be.
                With 15 years of dance experience in styles like contemporary, ballet, and hip hop, I love challenging
                my body with new ways of moving. Swing and Waltz have quickly become my favorite styles, blending
                technique with creativity and connection. Whether you’re here to learn, meet new people, or just have
                fun, I’m excited to share the dance floor with you!

                Hey friends, I’m Ixmar, a 3rd year psychology student. When I joined this club last semester I had no
                dance experience, but I have always loved being able to dance and make up moves to whatever song is
                playing. This club has not only been welcoming but an extraordinary environment to meet new people that
                all want a bit of fun and dance. Learning so many styles has made these classes some of the days I look
                forward to the most, whether it’s to spend time with new friends or learn another move to bust out on a
                whim. Come give it a try! Worse comes to worst, you love it so much you don’t want to stop dancing!
