        The UVic Ballroom Dance Club is run by a group of volunteer students. They hire professional instructors
        to teach classes, they plan events and workshops. If you are interested in joining the executive and helping
        run the club, please talk to one of the executive or email us at ballroom@uvicdance.com!

          This is my third year with the club and the executive and since joining I've had an amazing time.
          This club has continuously defied my expectations. I had no prior dance experience when I joined,
          but through the teaching of the amazing instructors, the super friendly (and very patient) members and
          the great social events that happen every weekend, I've progressed tremendously. The ballroom club is
          a great way to meet people, and I've made some really good friends this year. Finally, I was completely
          blown away by the awesome social events that happen around Victoria. Come to Swing City, it will change
          the way you think about a Friday night. Anyway before I start rambling if you see me at practice or out
          on the dance floor don't hesitate to approach me with any questions you might have, or just to ask for a
          dance. I will do my best to assist you in both areas. Happy dancing and see you on the floor!

          As a dancer was born under the pale light of an unexceptional moon, on a not at all significant day,
          wolves were howling... somewhere in the world. Probably. Maybe. A tenth of a decade ago, when he was but
          an ickle little first year, Ryan discovered the unadulterated joy of partner dancing and speaking in the
          third person plural. The Ryans could not get over how they and a stranger could improvise with perfect
          synchrony. It was bebop made physical for the Ryans. In a desire to possess all the dances of the world
          and introduce dance to future generations, they joined the club executive, and started talking in the
          third person plural possessive future tense. As a member of the exec, it will be the Ryans’ hopes to
          encounter many unique pokemon, humans, and undergrads. Ask for the Ryans’ dances when you see their feet
          on the dance floor!

          Thanks for checking out the club! I’ve been dancing since I was 5, whether ballet, contemporary, or tap,
          and was excited to try a new dance form in my first year at UVic. Have no fear – you do not need any dance
          experience whatsoever. In fact, the friendly, encouraging environment is what got me hooked. Get ready to
          meet an inclusive community that finds several opportunities to get involved in dancing: beach dancing,
          social events/workshops around town, competitions, and more. Take your pick! Now in my fourth and final
          year of my Psychology degree, I’ve become more involved as an executive member and look forward to our
          upcoming dance lessons, events, and flash mob, not to mention meeting YOU!

          I’m excited to say this will be my third year with the UVic Ballroom Club and being part of the Executive
          team. In my first year at UVic I really wanted to join at least one club so I could meet new people and
          get involved with the student life. UVic Ballroom turned out to be the perfect choice because it had the
          social aspect I was looking for, I got to learn a new skill and it was form of exercise! I always look
          forward to lessons each weekend, but the best part is being able to use the moves I’ve learned at UVic out
          in the community at dances like Swing City and Nothin’but Swing! I’ve always loved to dance, but now I’m
          addicted!<br/><br/>

          Hi everyone! <br/><br/>
          I joined the UVic ballroom dance club during my first year at the University of Victoria and I am
          extremely glad that I did. The UVic ballroom dance club has given me the opportunity to meet some
          really amazing people, have lots of fun, and learn a lifelong skill. Other than a few childhood dance
          classes, I had not done much dancing before I joined the club. Anyone with any level of dancing experience
          is welcome. I hope to see you out on the dance floor!

          I am a 4th year student at UVic, and joined the UVic Ballroom Club in my third year because I wanted to
          learn how to dance. As my lack of disinterest in high school caused me to feel that I missed out on
          something fun and exciting. I started taking their Salsa lessons and I fell in love with the dance.
          This year I joined the UVic Ballroom Club's exec team as their photographer, because I wanted to give
          back to the club for all the amazing and fun times the club has given me.

          I have been dancing my whole life. When I was 6 I finally started lessons, and haven't stopped since!
          Growing up, I mainly did ballet, with a few other dances (jazz, contemporary, musical theatre) thrown
          in for good measure. Now I've found ballroom and it's possibly the most fun I've ever had dancing.
          It's social, there is so much variety, and everyone in the club has always been incredibly welcoming.
          Whatever your skill level, come have fun!<br/><br/>

          These days I can be found at lessons on the weekends, Swing City on Friday nights, and twirling around
          campus when I think nobody is watching.

            Welcome to the UVic Ballroom Dance Club (UVBDC)!  As a Vikes Rec 
            Club, we believe that ballroom dancing improves physical and social 
            wellbeing and enhances quality of life! We offer lessons not only 
            in Standard Ballroom (like waltz, foxtrot, and tango), but also 
            Latin Ballroom, East Coast Swing, Salsa, Merengue and Bachata.  
            You don’t need a partner or any dance experience 
            (having two left feet is fine), just show up and get ready to have 
            fun, meet new people, and, of course, learn how to dance!.
