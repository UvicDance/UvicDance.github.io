            I’m excited to say this will be my third year with the UVic 
            Ballroom Club and being part of the Executive team. In my first 
            year at UVic I really wanted to join at least one club so I 
            could meet new people and get involved with the student life. 
            UVic Ballroom turned out to be the perfect choice because it 
            had the social aspect I was looking for, I got to learn a new 
            skill and it was form of exercise! I always look forward to 
            lessons each weekend, but the best part is being able to use 
            the moves I’ve learned at UVic out in the community at dances 
            like Swing City and Nothin’but Swing! I’ve always loved to 
            dance, but now I’m addicted!<br><br>

            In my first year of university, I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance 
            Club, and I can suggest that you do to. Before joining the club, 
            I had never done Ballroom Dancing before, but the club was very 
            welcoming and I had lots of fun learning the different types of 
            dance. I also  made many friends in the club and I am happy to 
            now be helping out with the Club. I hope that everyone considers 
            joining the Ballroom Dance Club, as it is a great experience!

            I’ve been involved in music and dance my whole life, and I joined 
            the UVic BDC in the hopes of learning a new dance or two. The club 
            was so welcoming, and the lessons so much fun, that my love for 
            ballroom dance quickly climbed to the level of “obsession”. The 
            club has given me joy and a place in a vibrant community. When 
            I’m not dancing, I spend my time working towards my Batchelor’s 
            degree in Anthropology and reading far too many fantasy novels.

            I have been dancing my whole life. When I was 6 I finally started 
            lessons, and haven't stopped since! Growing up, I mainly did 
            ballet, with a few other dances (jazz, contemporary, musical 
            theatre) thrown in for good measure. Now I've found ballroom and 
            it's possibly the most fun I've ever had dancing. It's social, 
            there is so much variety, and everyone in the club has always 
            been incredibly welcoming. Whatever your skill level, come have 
            fun!<br><br>

            These days I can be found at lessons on the weekends, Swing City on 
            Friday nights, and twirling around campus when I think nobody is 
            watching.

            This is my third year in the club and my first as part of the exec. 
            I first joined the club to try something completely new to me. I 
            had zero dancing experience before joining the club, but since then 
            I've learned a lot and enjoyed it all the while, and I'm happy to 
            now have the opportunity to give back to the club. Regardless of 
            skill level, the club is a great place to come and have a good 
            time. I hope to see you on the dance floor!

            I joined the UVic Ballroom Dance Club in my first semester. Before 
            joining the club, I had danced ballet and musical theater, but it 
            was the first time I tried social dancing, and I'm glad that I did. 
            The more I learn about dance, the more I enjoy it, and I predict 
            that you will too. The Ballroom Dance Club is filled with a 
            wonderful and diverse group of people who would like to be your 
            friend. Join us and dance away the stress of school!<br><br>
